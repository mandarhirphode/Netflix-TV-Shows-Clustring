# 🎬 Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

### 📌 Project Type: Unsupervised Machine Learning

### 🧑‍💻 Contribution: Individual Project

---

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on applying **Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques** to cluster movies and TV shows available on Netflix (as of 2019). The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from **Flixable**, a third-party Netflix search engine.

The objective is to understand the patterns and types of content that Netflix offers, uncover hidden groupings, and derive actionable insights through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and clustering methods.

## 📊 Business Context

Netflix has seen a significant shift in content distribution over the years. While the number of TV shows has almost tripled since 2010, the movie catalog has shrunk by over 2,000 titles. This project explores these dynamics and clusters content based on their attributes to uncover deeper trends and opportunities.

There is also potential to integrate this dataset with external sources such as IMDb ratings or Rotten Tomatoes scores to enrich the clustering and gain further insights.

## 📌 Objectives

* Perform detailed **EDA** to understand data structure and quality.
* Apply **data preprocessing** steps including handling missing values and encoding.
* Use **clustering algorithms** like K-Means to group similar content.
* Visualize the clusters to interpret grouping behavior.
* Derive insights from the formed clusters and assess business implications.
